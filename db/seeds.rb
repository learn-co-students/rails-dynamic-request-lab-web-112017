# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  Student.create(first_name: 'Tim', last_name: 'Smith')
  Student.create(first_name: 'Phil', last_name: 'Collins')
  Student.create(first_name: 'Jammy', last_name: 'Jones')
  Student.create(first_name: 'Angela', last_name: 'Merkel')
  Student.create(first_name: 'Sally', last_name: 'Sitwell')
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
